                        <div class="terms-data">
                            <p class="desc_p">1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS<br/>
                            EBR is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement sets forth our current privacy practices with regard to the information we collect when you or your computer interact with our website. By accessing EBR you acknowledge and fully understand EBR’s Privacy Statement and freely consent to the information collection and use practices described in this Website Privacy Statement.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">2. RULES AND GUIDELINES FOR USE</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">These rules and guidelines are essential for keeping our community running as smoothly as possible. Please keep in mind these rules whenever creating content to keep our community pleasant for members and guests alike. Access to the community is a privilege, not a right, and members who continually breach these rules will find themselves limited or removed from the community, regardless of the other contributions they have made.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">The EBR community is focused on discussing electric bicycles and related topics (such as electric motor technology, ebike legislation, and ebike events), giving and receiving help and guidance related to electric bicycles, and coordinating offline communities of electric bicycle riders. Your behavior on the EBR platform should reflect that. The rules here are not exhaustive and will be modified over time as necessary, please use common sense when creating content, and refer to the EBR <a href="">Etiquette Forum</a> for more information.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">2.1. EBR is a platform for a business and should be viewable in business contexts or by children. Please do not post anything which is inappropriate in a business setting. This includes, but is not limited to, profanity, sexual, sexualized or illicit content, hateful, threatening, provocative or vulgar content, links and websites and discussion encouraging the use of piracy or warez distributions, or any otherwise illegal content. Please do not attempt to circumvent the censoring options we have set up.<br/>
                            2.2. Be courteous and respect your fellow members. To be clear, personal attacks, aggressive messages, and passive-aggressive behavior is unacceptable. If you take particular issue with another user and are unable to reply in a civilized and constructive way to their posts, you should ignore the user.<br/>
                            2.3. Posts should always be constructive and on topic. For common issues, simply telling someone to search is not acceptable. If you disagree with a post and feel the need to reply as such, it’s important that you explain why. Off topic posts may be moved or deleted as required. Discussions about politics and religion are NOT ALLOWED, and yes, this includes in the off-topic forum section!<br/>
                            2.4. If you feel another user is attacking or being aggressive towards you, report their message to staff. Do not respond publicly. This simply continues the back and forth that derails topics and makes them uncomfortable for other users. If someone attacks you and you respond with an attack, you will be warned regardless of who started it.<br/>
                            2.5. If you recommend a product or service and link to it with an affiliate code, you must disclose the affiliate relationship.<br/>
                            2.6. Personal information and private discussions may not be posted unless it’s clear that all parties involved have consented.<br/>
                            2.7. If a moderator or staff member takes an action or posts a directive (for example, to stop with a particular topic), you must adhere to this. If you discover a directive only after you’ve posted a message that contravenes it, delete your post or it will be taken to be ignoring moderators.<br>
                            2.8. If you have a problem with or question about a moderator’s decision, contact the moderator privately or submit a message through the contact system. Posts or topics discussing moderator actions will be removed.<br/>
                            2.9. Each user may only have one account. If duplicate accounts are discovered, the duplicates may be banned.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">3. MEMBER CREATED CONTENT<br/>
                            EBR is a public platform and is used by many individuals to create content and share opinions. EBR is not responsible for any user-generated content and accounts. Content submitted express the views of their author only. All content you submit, upload, or otherwise make available to EBR may be reviewed by staff members. All content you submit or upload may be sent to third-party verification services (including, but not limited to, spam prevention services). Do not submit any content that you consider to be private or confidential.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">You agree to not use EBR to submit or link to any content which is defamatory, abusive, hateful, threatening, spam or spam-like, likely to offend, contains adult or objectionable content, contains personal information of others, risks copyright infringement, encourages unlawful activity, or otherwise violates any laws. You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that content or your conduct.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">We may remove or modify any content submitted at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Requests for content to be removed or modified will be undertaken only at our discretion.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">You are granting us with a non-exclusive, permanent, irrevocable, unlimited license to use, publish, or re-publish your content in connection with EBR. You retain copyright over the content.</p>

                            <p class="desc_p">4. ACCOUNT ACCESS AND TERMINATION<br/>
                            We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable information in your web account file is correct and current. You may review this information by logging in and visiting your account settings page, or by contacting us directly via our <a href="/contact/">contact us page</a>.</p>

                            <p class="desc_p">We may terminate your access to all or any part of EBR at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">You may not access the Service through automated or programmatic means (such as through a content scraper) without prior permission from us.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">You may delete your account and all personally identifying information from the EBR platform at any time by requesting this action to be taken from an EBR staff member or by contacting us directly via our <a href="/contact/">contact us page</a>.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">5. PARTICIPATING MERCHANT POLICIES<br/>
                            Related services and offerings with links from this website, including vendor sites, have their own privacy statements that can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. Online merchants and others who participate in EBR services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants and other third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">6. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT<br/>
                            EBR collects certain information from and about its users in three primary ways: directly from our Web Server logs, the user, and with Cookies.
                            </p>
                            <p class="desc_p">a. Web Server Logs. – When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include:</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">Your Internet protocol address.<br/>
                            The kind of browser or computer you use.<br/>
                            The number of links you click within the site.<br/>
                            State or country from which you accessed the site.<br/>
                            Date and time of your visit.<br/>
                            Name of your Internet service provider.<br/>
                            Web page you linked to our site from<br/>
                            Pages you viewed on the site.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">b. Use of Cookies – EBR may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">One of the primary purposes of using cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.<br/>
                            EBR reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is overriding customer value (such as merging into EBR a site or widget that relies on third-party cookies). We use Google Analytics, YouTube Statistics, Xenforo software, and Facebook Pixel to create and recommend relevant content across different platforms.<br/>
                            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">c. Personal Information – Visitors to our website can register to purchase services. When you register, we will request some personal information such as name, address, email, telephone number or facsimile number, account number and other relevant information. If you are purchasing a service, we will request financial information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider. If you purchase via PayPal this information may be forwarded to PayPal. For other types of registrations, we will ask for the relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.<br/>
                            We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to third parties without your permission except to the extent necessary including:</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">To fulfill your service requests for services<br/>
                            To protect ourselves from liability<br/>
                            To respond to legal process or comply with the law, or<br/>
                            In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">If at any time you should choose to discontinue a purchased service, we will need a formal request to discontinue in writing, with a minimum lead time of 30 days prior to requested termination date. These rules apply to all purchased service terminations, unless stated in a secondary contract, whereas the terms of the secondary contract will supersede the above.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">7. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES<br/>
                            EBR web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow EBR to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. EBR may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.<br/>
                            Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third-party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. EBR prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">8. GDPR COMPLIANCE<br/>
                            We are compliant the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Keeping users’ information safe and secure is among our highest priorities at EBR. Over the years, we have spent time and energy choosing secure content management platforms, keeping them up to date, and securing our servers. We have already implemented strong privacy protections that reflect GDPR guidance, and we are committed to remaining compliant with any changes to the legislation and will collaborate with partners throughout this process.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">9. ADVERTISING SERVICES<br/>
                            Local and national advertising services constitute an at-will arrangement that may be discontinued at any time, but should you choose to discontinue service, we will need a formal request to discontinue in writing, with a minimum lead time of 30 days prior to requested termination date. Local Listings Advertisers are responsible for providing up to date information about their shop name, location, phone number, and website address. You can provide updates at any time by <a href="/contact/">contacting us.</a></p>
                            <p class="desc_p">By advertising with EBR you agree that there is no action, suit or proceeding, at law or in equity, by any person, nor any arbitration, administrative or other proceeding by or before (or to the best of the knowledge of the corporation any investigation by) any governmental entity pending, or, to the best of the knowledge of the corporation, threatened against or affecting the corporation or any of its properties or rights or any of the assets, and the corporation does not know of any valid basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or investigation.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">EBR is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, AvantLink affiliate program, and Skimlinks affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising and commission fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com, avantlink.com, skimlinks.com, etc. but I personally (Courtney Rye) strive to remain objective and unbiased in the presentation and ranking of products on this site.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">Some Reviews posted to EBR are created with the support of manufacturers. This may include travel, hotel, and food reimbursement or direct service payment. Paid content such as this is always acknowledged with clear messaging at the beginning of the content. It is my goal as a reviewer to provide the most objective, fair and unbiased content possible, regardless of monetary support.</p>
                            <p class="desc_p">10. CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT<br/>
                            EBR has the discretion to occasionally update this privacy statement at any time. When we do, we will also revise the “updated” date at the top of this Privacy page. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
                            </p>
